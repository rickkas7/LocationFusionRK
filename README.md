# LocationFusionRK

*Library for Particle devices to generate enhanced geolocation requests*

The Tracker One, Tracker SoM, and Monitor One already include built-in support for enhanced location services or [location fusion](https://docs.particle.io/reference/tracker/location-fusion/). Other devices, however, can take advantage of these services in some cases, and this library can simplify doing so.
